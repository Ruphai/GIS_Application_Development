about=This python geoprocessing tool computes the landscape metrics on a zone level using categorical vector layers. The specific functions that this toolbox provides include: I. A direct analysis of user-defined vector-based categorical (polygon) layers, II. Computation of a set of available landscape metrics calculated within any user-defined zones â€“ regular gridded zones, administrative zones, or even environmental zones, III. For specific applications users can generate specialized pie or hexagonal zones. It is important to note that regular sampling display better patterns and/ or processes in the landscape compared to other pre-defined units due to their equal area and perimeter that creates statistically similar units across the area being analyzed, and a defensible statistical basis for sampling purposes.
